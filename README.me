## Quick Start for Lovable.dev

### Option 1: Deploy Both Client and Server

Upload this entire package to Lovable.dev and ask:

> “Deploy this WH15P3R secure chat system. The client should be a static site accessible via HTTPS. The server is a Node.js WebSocket signaling server that should run on port 3000. Make sure to update the SIGNALING_SERVER URL in client/index.html to point to the deployed server.”

### Option 2: Deploy Client Only (Separate Server)

If you want to deploy the signaling server separately (recommended for security):

1. Deploy `client/index.html` as a static site on Lovable.dev
1. Deploy `server/` directory on Vultr or other VPS
1. Update line 294 in `client/index.html` with your server URL

-----

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory:

```env
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production
```

-----

## Server Requirements

- Node.js 16+ (18 LTS recommended)
- 1GB RAM minimum
- HTTPS/WSS for production (Lovable handles this automatically)
- Firewall allowing port 3000 for WebSocket connections

-----

## Client Deployment

The client is a single HTML file with no dependencies. It can be deployed:

- As a static site on any host
- Via Lovable.dev
- On GitHub Pages
- On IPFS for censorship resistance
- On any CDN

**Critical:** Must be served over HTTPS for WebRTC to work properly.

-----

## Post-Deployment Configuration

After deployment, you MUST update the signaling server URL:

**In `client/index.html`:**

Search for `const SIGNALING_SERVER` (in the JavaScript section near line 300):

```javascript
// Change this:
const SIGNALING_SERVER = 'ws://localhost:3000';

// To your deployed server:
const SIGNALING_SERVER = 'wss://your-domain.com';
// or
const SIGNALING_SERVER = 'wss://your-server-ip:3000';
```

-----

## Testing the Deployment

1. Open the client URL in two different browser windows (Chrome 142+ recommended)
1. Click “WH15P3R CHAT” in first window
1. Copy the session code
1. Paste code in second window and click “JOIN SESSION”
1. Both should show green border and “✓ SECURE P2P CONNECTION ESTABLISHED”
1. Look for “🔒 Q POST-QUANTUM ACTIVE” badge (if using Chrome 142+)

-----

## Security Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] Client served over HTTPS (required)
- [ ] Server uses WSS (WebSocket Secure)
- [ ] Firewall configured on server
- [ ] No logging enabled on server
- [ ] Domain registered privately
- [ ] Test with Tor Browser
- [ ] Verify post-quantum encryption active
- [ ] Review user guide with potential users

## For Lovable.dev: Deployment Instructions

When uploading to Lovable.dev, provide this prompt:

```
I have a secure P2P chat application called WH15P3R.

ARCHITECTURE:
- Client: Single HTML file (client/index.html) - static site
- Server: Node.js WebSocket signaling server (server/)

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Deploy client as static HTTPS site
2. Deploy server as Node.js app on port 3000 with WSS support
3. Update SIGNALING_SERVER constant in index.html (line 294) to point to deployed server URL
4. Ensure CORS is enabled on server
5. No database needed - everything is ephemeral

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
- MUST use HTTPS for client (WebRTC requirement)
- MUST use WSS (secure WebSocket) for server
- No logging of message content
- Minimal server footprint

DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS:
- Option A: Deploy both on your platform
- Option B: I'll deploy server separately on Vultr, just deploy client as static site

Please deploy and provide:
1. Client URL (static site)
2. Server URL (WebSocket endpoint)
3. Instructions to update SIGNALING_SERVER if needed
```

-----

## Notes for Manual Deployment

If Lovable.dev has limitations, you can:

**Client (Easy):**

- Upload `client/index.html` to any web host
- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Any static hosting

**Server (Requires VPS):**

- Vultr (recommended - Sweden/Iceland for privacy)
- DigitalOcean
- Linode
- AWS EC2
- Any VPS with Node.js support

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for complete manual instructions.

## Architecture Overview

```
User A's Browser ←→ [HTTPS/WSS] ←→ Signaling Server ←→ [HTTPS/WSS] ←→ User B's Browser
                                          ↓
                                    Facilitates WebRTC handshake
                                    (never sees message content)
                                          ↓
User A's Browser ←――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――→ User B's Browser
                    Direct P2P Connection (DTLS 1.3 + ML-KEM)
                    Post-Quantum Encrypted Messages
                    No server involvement
```

**Key Points:**

- Signaling server only helps establish P2P connection
- After connection, all messages go directly peer-to-peer
- Signaling server never sees message content
- Post-quantum encryption protects against future quantum computers
- No data stored anywhere

## Contact and Support

For questions about deployment or security:

- Review included documentation first
- Check browser compatibility (Chrome 142+, Firefox 120+ for PQ)
- Ensure HTTPS/WSS for production
- Test with Tor Browser for anonymity

**Remember:** This tool provides strong encryption but cannot protect compromised endpoints. Users must practice good operational security.
